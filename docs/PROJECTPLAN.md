# Plugin.Maui.NearbyDevices - Optimal Project Plan

## 📝 Anti-Detail-Trap Strategy

**Key Principle**: _Ship early, iterate fast, avoid perfectionism_

### The 80/20 Rule Timeline

-   **20% effort = 80% value**: Focus on core MVP features first
-   **Time-box everything**: Set hard deadlines to prevent scope creep
-   **Validate early**: Get feedback before building complex features

## ⚡ Detail-Trap Avoidance System

### 🎓 Common Detail Traps & Solutions

#### Trap 1: "Perfect API Design"

-   **❙ Instead of**: Spending weeks designing the "perfect" interface
-   **✅ Do this**: Copy existing successful APIs (Plugin.BLE structure)
-   **Time limit**: 2 days max for initial interface

#### Trap 2: "Complete Feature Set"

-   **❙ Instead of**: Building file transfer, streams, encryption, etc.
-   **✅ Do this**: Start with discovery + basic messaging only
-   **Rule**: If it's not in your MVP interface, don't build it

#### Trap 3: "Perfect Error Handling"

-   **❙ Instead of**: Handling every possible edge case
-   **✅ Do this**: Basic try/catch with generic error events
-   **Rule**: Let users report what breaks, then fix it

#### Trap 4: "Comprehensive Testing"

-   **❙ Instead of**: 90% test coverage before first release
-   **✅ Do this**: Basic happy path tests, manual device testing
-   **Rule**: Tests come after users validate the concept

### 🔓 Weekly Focus Framework

**Each week, ask yourself:**

1. **What's the ONE thing that gets me closer to a NuGet publish?**
2. **What would users actually use in a real app?**
3. **What can I cut without losing core value?**

### 📝 Success Metrics (Not Lines of Code)

-   **Week 4**: Published to NuGet ✅
-   **Week 8**: 10+ downloads ✅
-   **Week 12**: First GitHub issue from a real user ✅

---

**Remember**: Your goal isn't to build the perfect plugin - it's to become a published NuGet author and validate market demand. Everything else can be improved in v2.0.0!
